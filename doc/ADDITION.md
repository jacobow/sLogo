### Estimation
* This addition will take me less than ten minutes to write.
* I think I will need to update one class and create
two others.  I will update the model class to give it stamp functionality, and then I will create the other two command classes.

### Review
* It took me 5 minutes.
* I had to update one file and create two others, exactly as I stated beforehand.
* Yes, I got it right on the first try.  Frontend functionality would have to be implemented to see the results, but the backend logic is there.
### Analysis
* I think it reveals that our project was easily extensible, and that adding new commands was something we considered and planned for from the start in our original design.
* Documentation could be improved.
* It would have been more difficult if I had not been familiar with the Model class, but writing the two new command classes was very straight forward and would be to anyone.
